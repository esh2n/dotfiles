gui_log_window: false
# Whether to open a graphical window with Serena's logs.
# This is mainly supported on Windows and (partly) on Linux; not available on macOS.
# If you want to see the logs in a web browser, use the `web_dashboard` option instead.
# Limitations: doesn't seem to work with the community version of Claude Desktop for Linux
# Might also cause problems with some MCP clients - if you have any issues, try disabling this

web_dashboard: false
# Whether to open a web dashboard with Serena's logs in your browser.
# Setting this to false reduces context switching when using Claude Code,
# as you won't need to switch between terminal and web browser.
# Logs will still be available via the GUI log window if enabled.
